- Axolotl (The cutest)
- Movie with a nice plot (I like the pose-traumatic growth. Share me your favorite!)
- Personality Talk (I studied psychology but I like to talk about MBTI the shit. Sorry. I really like the environment to freely talk about themselves and their personality. I also like the story of getting-to-know of both extremes.)
- Evolutionary psychology (lowkey)

Dislike
