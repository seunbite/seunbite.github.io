I love psychology because psychologists come up with the very clever ideas how to measure the unseen human mind (operational definitions).

- Agressiveness by giving hot sauce ([Lieberman, 1999](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-hot-new-way-to-measure-aggression%3A-Hot-sauce-Lieberman-Solomon/3a789895c3e18f9e3356e98feda68521b726f294))
- Conscientiousness by Room cleanness ([Gosling, 2002](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-823379.pdf))


However, I found myself wanting a more direct and faster way to test and demonstrate my hypotheses about the social desire and fulfillment of humans. I am truely interested in dealing robot as new social cue stimuli based on strong assumption that human has weak and attackable censoring system to the social sign from other one. I like the numeric tables and plots which can intuitively and reproductively show the contribution of the study.
