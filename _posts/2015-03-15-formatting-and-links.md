I loved learning psychology because psychologists design clever experiments to understand parts of the complex human mind (operational definitions). I’ve always been the kind of person who is fascinated by relationships, social dynamics, and emotional exchange even from a very young age. However, as psychology evolved with many procedures and rules to ensure reproducibility, I found myself wanting a more direct and faster way to test and demonstrate my hypotheses. I like score tables, demos in computer science and robotics, and real user feedback whether from experiences with deployed systems or reactions across X posts when launching open-source projects. My research interests always come back to real humans. Real humans and robots/AI inspire me with ideas to understand each other from both sides.
