I’ve always been the kind of person who is fascinated by relationships, social dynamics, and emotional exchange even from a very young age. However, as psychology evolved with many procedures and rules to ensure reproducibility, I found myself wanting a more direct and faster way to test and demonstrate my hypotheses. I like score tables, demos in computer science and robotics, and real user feedback whether from experiences with deployed systems or reactions across X posts when launching open-source projects. My research interests always come back to real humans. Real humans and robots/AI inspire me with ideas to understand each other from both sides.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="me"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[FAQ that I love to answer]]></summary></entry></feed>
